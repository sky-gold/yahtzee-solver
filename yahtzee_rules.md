# Yahtzee Game Rules

## Gameplay
Each player gets up to three dice rolls per turn. After the first roll, you can keep any dice and re-roll the others. For example, if you roll 1,3,3,4,6 and want a large straight (1,2,3,4,5), you could keep 1,3,4 and re-roll the 3 and 6.

## Upper Section
- **Ones through Sixes**: Sum of all dice showing that number
- **Bonus**: If upper section total ≥ 63, add 35 bonus points

## Lower Section
- **Three of a Kind**: Three dice with same number. Score: sum of all dice
- **Four of a Kind**: Four dice with same number. Score: sum of all dice  
- **Full House**: Three of a kind + pair. 25 points
- **Small Straight**: Four sequential dice. 30 points
- **Large Straight**: Five sequential dice. 40 points
- **Chance**: Sum of all dice
- **Yahtzee**: Five of a kind. 50 points

## Multiple Yahtzees
If you already have a Yahtzee and roll another:
- +100 bonus points
- **Joker**: you can fill any empty category
- If the corresponding upper section category is open - you must choose it
- If upper category is filled - choose any lower category

If you have zero in Yahtzee - no bonus, but joker rules still apply.
